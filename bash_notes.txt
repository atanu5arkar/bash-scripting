CH-23
------

- You can write a script to a file with no extension. If the script is valid and the file has required permission(s), you can run it.

- It's a good practice to start your script with #! (she-bang) followed by the path of the shell that the script should run in, e.g. #!/bin/bash

- Lines beginning with # are treated as comments.

- name=value creates a variable "name". Use $name to access its value.

    * Bash treats all values as strings.

    * A script runs in its own environment (shell), so any variable declared in the script is inaccessible in your current shell. 
    
    * To run it in the same shell, you must source it: source ./file OR . ./file

- You can also run the script like so: bash file. It does not require you to change file permissions.

- Can use test command to evaluate Boolean expressions. (See the man page for usage syntax)

    * In Bash, semi-colon allows you to specify multiple commands on the same line. These cmds will be executed in sequence even if a few of them fail.
    
    Note: Use && if a command needs to run only when the previous one succeeds. 

    * test does not return any visible output; only its exit status changes (0 or 1) as per the truthiness of the expression. 
    
    * $? is a special variable (shell parameter) that captures the exit status of the last cmd. You can use it to print the boolean result.
